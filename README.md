# Data-Analysis
Projects on data analysis using either R, python, Sql or excel

There are 3 projects contained in this folder. First one which is casestudy.Rmd is a R project which focuses on a bicycle company and a full year analysis about their membership, amounts of rides, types of riders and so on and so forth. I demonstarated my skills in R using this project to analyze, clean up and draw out conclusions from the data set given to me. I also drew graphs using ggplot and other functions like that
My second one is a python script to automate and breake down a large excel file into what i want to use it for. I used requests library to download the excel file from the intenet, and used pandas to break down and analyze the file into a useful file that can be used by me and then saved it into my computer system.
My third project is using selenium to scrap data from airtel intenational calling rates page. I built this python script to collect information from airtel's website to be stored in my system

I am also very proefficient in Excel and SQL, PowerBI and Tableau and i will be adding more projects as time goes by. 

Thank You
